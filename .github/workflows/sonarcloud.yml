# This workflow is DISABLED - using SonarCloud Automatic Analysis instead
#
# Automatic Analysis is simpler and doesn't require CI integration.
# SonarCloud automatically scans code when pushed to main branch.
#
# To re-enable CI-based analysis:
# 1. Disable Automatic Analysis in SonarCloud project settings
# 2. Restore the CI workflow from sonarcloud.yml.disabled
# 3. Ensure SONAR_TOKEN secret is set in GitHub repository settings
#
# NOTE: This file is intentionally not a valid GitHub Actions workflow
# to prevent it from running. See sonarcloud.yml.disabled for the
# full CI-based analysis workflow.
