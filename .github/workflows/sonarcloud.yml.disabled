# This workflow is disabled - using SonarCloud Automatic Analysis instead
#
# Automatic Analysis is simpler and doesn't require CI integration.
# SonarCloud automatically scans code when pushed to main branch.
#
# To re-enable CI-based analysis:
# 1. Disable Automatic Analysis in SonarCloud
# 2. Rename this file back to sonarcloud.yml
# 3. Ensure SONAR_TOKEN secret is set
