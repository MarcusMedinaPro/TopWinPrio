Windows Foreground Priority Manager for gamers and multitaskers. TopWinPrio keeps your active window responsive by nudging CPU priorities on the fly‚Äîrevived as a community-driven, MIT-licensed project.

## Open Source Status

TopWinPrio is 100% open source under the [MIT License](LICENSE.txt). Source code, build scripts, issue history, and release binaries live in this public repository. Every `v*` tag is built in GitHub Actions with artifacts published to the Releases page so anyone can verify or fork the project.

## Project Status

- **Legacy refresh (complete):** The historical v1.0 sources build on GitHub Actions and publish artifacts directly from CI. No functionality changes were introduced.
- **Framework upgrades (in progress):** The WinForms app will step through supported .NET targets‚Äî.NET 4.x ‚Üí .NET 6 ‚Üí .NET 8‚Äîshipping binaries at every milestone so users can pick their runtime.
- **Modern rewrite (planned):** After the .NET 8 WinForms stabilization, the app will evolve into a Windows 11-ready experience (MAUI/WinUI candidate) with a background service plus configuration UI.

Follow upgrades or pitch ideas in [issues](https://github.com/MarcusMedina/TopWinPrio/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/MarcusMedina/TopWinPrio/pulls). Branding has moved from LunaWorX to MarcusMedinaPro; lingering references are cleaned up as files are touched.

## Features

- ‚öôÔ∏è **Foreground priority tuning** ‚Äì Automatically raises the active window‚Äôs priority while lowering background apps.
- üéÆ **Game-friendly defaults** ‚Äì Minimal UI, tray resident, and safe registry hooks for auto-start.
- üß∞ **Win32 interop** ‚Äì Managed wrapper around key Windows APIs (`SetPriorityClass`, `SetForegroundWindow`).
- üõ†Ô∏è **Configurable** ‚Äì Toggle auto-start, tray notifications, and per-process overrides via the UI.
- üì¶ **CI-packaged binaries** ‚Äì Reproducible builds with zipped artifacts ready for distribution.

## Runtime Requirements

Current production build targets **.NET Framework 3.5** (Win32).

- Windows XP SP3, Vista, and Windows 7 include 3.5 or install it via Windows Update.
- Windows 8/8.1/10/11 must enable the optional ".NET Framework 3.5 (includes 2.0 and 3.0)" feature or use the offline installer.
- The `TopWinPrio-exe-only.zip` artifact runs without an installer; it touches `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run` only when you enable auto-start, so removing the folder leaves no residue.

## Downloads

Releases are created automatically whenever a tag matching `v*` is pushed. Each release currently publishes:

- `TopWinPrio-release.zip` ‚Äì zipped Release output (EXE, config, resources) for installers or manual deployment.
- `TopWinPrio-exe-only.zip` ‚Äì zip containing only the WinForms executable for quick copies.
- `TopWinPrio.exe` ‚Äì standalone executable artifact for rapid verification.
- `SHA256SUMS.txt` ‚Äì checksum manifest for every file attached to the release.

> üîê **Trust note:** Until the .NET 8 upgrade restores Certum signing, releases remain unsigned. Each tag build still runs on GitHub Actions, executes `dotnet test`, uploads artifacts, and performs a VirusTotal scan before the release is created so you can verify provenance.

Browse the latest packages on the [Releases page](https://github.com/MarcusMedina/TopWinPrio/releases).

## Quick Start

1. Download `TopWinPrio-release.zip` from the latest release.
2. Extract and run `TopWinPrio.exe`.
3. Right-click the tray icon to configure auto-start, notifications, and priority rules.
4. Optional: review the original manual (`Manual.pdf`) for historical usage notes.

## Build from Source

The legacy project lives in `TopWinPrio.CS/TopWinPrio.csproj`.

```powershell
msbuild TopWinPrio.sln /t:Build /p:Configuration=Release
```

The GitHub Action in `.github/workflows/build-test-scan-quality.yml` mirrors this process on a Windows runner, restoring NuGet packages, compiling Debug/Release, running the VirusTotal check, and publishing artifacts; when a tag is pushed the same workflow also creates the GitHub Release and attaches the packaged assets automatically.

### Local Development Tips

- Use Visual Studio with the `.sln` file for quickest iteration.
- Run `msbuild TopWinPrio.sln /p:RunCodeAnalysis=true` to surface StyleCop warnings.
- Manual validation remains the primary QA path until automated UI tests are introduced.

## Roadmap

**Current Status**: üö¢ Shipping unsigned (VirusTotal-scanned) compatibility builds until signing resumes with the .NET 8 upgrade.

**Migration Strategy**: One .NET version at a time; defer Certum signing until the `.NET 8 (v4.x)` phase (checksums + VirusTotal coverage continue meanwhile).

| Phase | Framework | Status | Release Tag |
|-------|-----------|--------|-------------|
| 1Ô∏è‚É£ Legacy | .NET Framework 3.5 | ‚úÖ Released (unsigned) | `v1.x-net35` |
| 2Ô∏è‚É£ Modernization | .NET Framework 4.8 | ‚è∏Ô∏è Ready to start | `v2.x-net48` |
| 3Ô∏è‚É£ Cross-platform prep | .NET 6 | üìã Planned | `v3.x-net6` |
| 4Ô∏è‚É£ Latest runtime | .NET 8 | üìã Planned (signing resumes) | `v4.x-net8` |
| 5Ô∏è‚É£ Next-gen UI | MAUI/WinUI + Service | üîÆ Future (after v4.x) | `v5.x` |

**Migration Focus**: Only framework upgrades until .NET 8. No feature work until v4.x is released.

üìñ **Full details**: See [MIGRATION_ROADMAP.md](MIGRATION_ROADMAP.md) for complete migration plan and checklist.

## Verify Downloads

- **Checksums:** Every release ships with `SHA256SUMS.txt`. On Windows you can run `Get-FileHash .\TopWinPrio.exe -Algorithm SHA256` and compare with the manifest entry; on macOS/Linux use `shasum -a 256 file`.
- **VirusTotal:** The `üß™ Build Test & Scan Quality` workflow uploads the built binaries to VirusTotal automatically. Check the workflow logs or release notes for run IDs if you want to cross-reference the scan.
- **Code signing roadmap:** Starting with the `.NET 8 (v4.x)` release, all executables and installers will be signed with the Certum certificate again. Until then, rely on the published checksums plus the VirusTotal scan history for authenticity.

## Contributing

Contributor guidance‚Äîincluding coding style, testing expectations, and CI details‚Äîis maintained in [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md). For quick reference:

- Fork the repo, create a feature branch from `main`.
- Run `msbuild` locally and ensure the workflow succeeds.
- Open a PR with screenshots for UI tweaks and describe manual testing.
- Replace any lingering ‚ÄúLunaWorX‚Äù branding with MarcusMedinaPro.
