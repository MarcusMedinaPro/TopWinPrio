Fix all warnings and runtime issues for v3.0.0 release

**Fixed Nullable Warnings (Resources.cs):**
- Made resourceCulture and resourceMan nullable
- Made Culture property nullable
- Used null-forgiving operator for embedded resources
- Converted to file-scoped namespace

**Fixed Runtime Crash:**
- ProcessPriorityClass default value (0) invalid
- Initialize oldProc with ProcessPriorityClass.Normal
- Added validation in SetProcessPrio()
- Check ProcessID > 0 and Enum.IsDefined()

**Impact:**
- Application starts without crashing
- Clean build with no warnings
- All nullable reference types properly handled
