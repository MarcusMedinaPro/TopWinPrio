# Security Policy

Thank you for helping keep TopWinPrio and its users safe.

## Supported Versions

Security fixes currently target the `main` branch and the latest tagged releases generated from it. Older releases remain available for historical purposes but may not receive patches.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

1. **Email** `security@marcusmedina.pro` with a descriptive subject (e.g., `TopWinPrio Security Report`).
2. Include:
   - A concise description of the issue and potential impact.
   - Steps to reproduce or proof-of-concept code, if available.
   - Suggested mitigations or patches (optional but appreciated).
3. Please allow up to 3 business days for acknowledgment and coordinate disclosure timelines with the maintainer.

Avoid filing public GitHub issues for vulnerabilities until a fix is released. Coordinated disclosure keeps users safe while we prepare patches.

## Disclosure Process

- Valid reports receive credit (unless you prefer anonymity) in release notes.
- Critical issues may trigger fast-follow releases and notifications via the README and project announcements.
- If you do not receive acknowledgment within 5 business days, feel free to escalate by contacting Marcus Ackre Medina through alternative channels listed on [marcusmedina.pro](https://marcusmedina.pro/).

Thank you for being part of the community and protecting fellow users.
