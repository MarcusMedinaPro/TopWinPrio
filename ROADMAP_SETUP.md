## Manual Steps Required

### Create Project Board
1. Go to https://github.com/MarcusMedina/TopWinPrio/projects
2. Click **"New project"**
3. Choose **"Board"** template
4. Name: **"TopWinPrio Modernization Roadmap"**

   - ðŸ“‹ Backlog
   - ðŸ”„ In Progress
   - ðŸ‘€ In Review
   - âœ… Done
6. Link issues to the board
7. Organize by milestone

### Configure Issue Templates
Create `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` files for:
- Bug reports
- Feature requests
- Migration tasks

## Viewing the Roadmap

### Issues
```bash
# List all issues
gh issue list --limit 50

# Filter by milestone
gh issue list --milestone ".NET 4.x Migration"

# Filter by label
gh issue list --label "migration"
```

### Milestones
```bash
# List milestones
gh milestone list

# View specific milestone
gh issue list --milestone ".NET 4.x Migration"
```

### Web Interface
- **Issues**: https://github.com/MarcusMedina/TopWinPrio/issues
- **Milestones**: https://github.com/MarcusMedina/TopWinPrio/milestones
- **Projects**: https://github.com/MarcusMedina/TopWinPrio/projects

## Workflow

### Starting a New Phase
1. Review milestone issues
2. Prioritize tasks
3. Create feature branch
4. Work through issues
5. Tag and release after milestone completion

### Issue Lifecycle
1. **Backlog** - Issue created, not started
2. **In Progress** - Someone is working on it
3. **In Review** - PR submitted, awaiting review
4. **Done** - Merged and deployed

### Tagging Strategy
- Legacy: `v1.x-net35` (.NET Framework 3.5)
- Phase 2a: `v2.x-net48` (.NET Framework 4.8)
- Phase 2b: `v3.x-net6` (.NET 6)
- Phase 2c: `v4.x-net8` (.NET 8)
- Phase 4: `v5.x` (Modern rewrite)

## CI/CD Integration

Each migration phase updates:
- `.github/workflows/build-legacy.yml` (or new workflow files)
- `AGENTS.md` (build instructions)
- `README.md` (runtime requirements)

## Updating the Roadmap

To add new issues:
```bash
gh issue create \
  --title "Issue title" \
  --body "Issue description" \
  --label "migration,enhancement" \
  --milestone ".NET 4.x Migration"
```

To modify milestones:
```bash
gh milestone edit ".NET 4.x Migration" --due-date 2025-03-01
```
