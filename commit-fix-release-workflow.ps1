Fix release workflow for .NET 8 SDK-style project

**Fixed Artifact Upload Path:**
- Changed from TopWinPrio.CS/bin/Release/*.exe
- To TopWinPrio.CS/TopWinPrio/bin/Release/net8.0-windows/*.exe
- SDK-style projects output to net8.0-windows subfolder

**Fixed Build Commands:**
- Replaced msbuild with dotnet build
- Removed unnecessary MSBuild and NuGet setup steps
- Simplified restore to dotnet restore

**Removed StyleCop:**
- Removed StyleCop-Report.log upload (no longer used)
- Kept CodeAnalysis-Report.log for compiler warnings

**Impact:**
- unsigned-bin artifact now uploads correctly
- Release pipeline can complete all 5 jobs
- Cleaner build process for .NET 8
